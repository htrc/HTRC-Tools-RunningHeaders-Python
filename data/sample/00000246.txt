“It’s Tom Saivyerl” 
 
 By jings, I most slumped through the floor. But there warn’t 
 no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand 
 and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time, how the 
 woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they 
 both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of 
 the tribe. 
 
 But if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for 
 it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I 
 was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last when my 
 chin was so tired it couldn’t hardly go, any more, I had told 
 them more about my family—I mean the Sawyer family—than 
 ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all 
 about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White 
 River and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, 
 and worked first rate; because they didn’t know but what it 
 would take three days to fix it. If I’d a called it a bolt-head it 
 would a done just as well. 
 
 Now 1 was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and 
 pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was 
 easy and comfortable; and it stayed easy and comfortable till 
 by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river— 
 then I says to myself, s’pose Tom Sawyer come down on that 
 boat?—and s’pose he steps in here, any minute, and sings out my 
 name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet? Well, I 
 couldn’t have it that way—it wouldn’t do at all. I must go up 
 the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would 
 go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentle¬ 
 man was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive 
 the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about 
 me.
