“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?” 
 
 “What put it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out hke he 
 knowed you?” 
 
 Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way: 
 
 “Well, that’s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing 
 out? What did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly calm, and 
 says, “Did you hear anybody sing out?” 
 
 Of course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; 
 so I says: 
 
 “No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.” 
 
 Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him
