Harvey’s way, but he said they waru’t. The frocks was hung 
 along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico 
 that hung down to the floor. There was an old hair trunk in one 
 corner, and a guitar box in another, and all sorts of little knick- 
 knacks andjimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with. 
 The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter 
 for these fixings, and so don’t disturb them. The duke’s room 
 was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my 
 cubby. 
 
 That night they had a big supper, and all them men and 
 women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke’s 
 chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest. 
 Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside 
 of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the 
 preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was 
 —and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force 
 out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tip¬ 
 top, and said so—said “How do you get biscuits to brown so 
 nice?” and “Where, for the land’s sake, did you get these amaz’n 
 pickles?” and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way 
 people always does at a supper, you know. 
 
 And when it was all done, me and the hare-lip had supper in 
 the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the 
 niggers clean up the tilings. The hare-lip she got to pumping 
 me about England, and blest if I didn’t think the ice was getting 
 mighty thin, sometimes. She says: 
 
 “Did you ever see the king?” 
 
 “Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have—he goes to our 
 church.” I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. 
 So when I says he goes to our church, she says: 
 
 “What—regular?” 
 
 “Yes—regular. His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other 
 side the pulpit.” 
 
 “I thought he lived in London?” 
 
 “Well, he does. Where would he live?”
