CHAPTER XIX 
 
 two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they 
 swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here 
 is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down 
 there—sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid 
 up and hid day-times; soon as night was most gone, we stopped 
 navigating and tied up—nearly always in the dead water under 
 a tow-head; and then cut young cotton-woods and willows and 
 hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid 
 into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; 
 then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was 
 about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound 
 anywheres—perfectly still—just like the whole world was asleep, 
 only sometimes the bull-frogs a-clattering, maybe. The first 
 tiling to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull 
 line—that was the woods on t’other side—you couldn’t make 
 nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, 
 spreading around; then the river softened up, away off, and 
 warn’t black any more, but grey; you could see little dark spots 
 drifting along, ever so far away—trading scows, and such things; 
 and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep 
 screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come 
 so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which 
 you know by the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a 
 swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that 
 way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east 
 reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin in the 
 edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other side of the river, 
 being a wood-yard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can 
 throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs 
 up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh, 
 and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; 
 but sometimes not that way, because they’ve left dead fish laying
