But he’s lucky, dey say, en I see I warn’t lucky. De dream say 
 let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’d make a raise for me. Well, 
 Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de 
 preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to de Lord, en 
 boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times. So Balum he tuck 
 en give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what wuz 
 gwyne to come of it.” 
 
 “Well, what did come of it, Jim?” 
 
 “Nuffn’ never come of it. I couldn’ manage to k’leck dat 
 money no way; en Balum he couldn’. I ain’t gwyne to len’ no 
 mo’ money ’dout I see de security. Boun’ to git yo’ money back 
 a hund’d times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten cents back, 
 I’d call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.” 
 
 “Well, it’s all right, anyway, Jim, long as you’re going to be 
 rich again some time or other.” 
 
 “Yes—en I’s rich now, come to look at it. I owns mysef, en 
 I’s wuth eight hund’d dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn’ 
 want no mo’.” 
 
 CHAPTER IX 
 
 i wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the 
 island, that I’d found when I was exploring; so we started, and 
 soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and 
 a quarter of a mile wide. 
 
 This place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge, about forty 
 foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was 
 so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and dumb around 
 all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, 
 most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was 
 as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could 
 stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting 
 our traps in there, right away, but I said we didn’t want to be 
 climbing up and down there all the time.
