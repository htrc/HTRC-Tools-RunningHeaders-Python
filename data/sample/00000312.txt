he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for 
 me. 
 
 And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss 
 Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom 
 Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a 
 free nigger free! and I couldn’t ever understand, before, until that

 “What letters?” 
 
 “Them letters. I be bound, if I have to take aholt of you 
 
 I’ll-” 
 
 “They’re in the trunk. There, now. And they’re just the same 
 as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain’t looked 
 into them, I hain’t touched them. But I knowed they’d make 
 trouble, and I thought if you warn’t in no hurry, I’d-” 
 
 “Well, you do need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it.
