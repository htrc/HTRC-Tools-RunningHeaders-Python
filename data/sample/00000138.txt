awful country—the raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! 
 
 I couldn’t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. 
 A voice not twenty-five foot from me, says: 
 
 “Good lan’! is dat you, honey? Doan’ make no noise.” 
 
 It was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I 
 run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed 
 me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says: 
 
 “Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin. 
 Jack’s been heah, he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ 
 come home no mo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a-startin’ de raf’ down 
 towards de mouf er de crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove 
 out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain 
 you is dead. Lawsy, I’s mighty glad to git you back agin, 
 honey.” 
 
 I says: 
 
 “All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and 
 they’ll think I’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s 
 something up there that’ll help them to think so—so don’t you 
 lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as 
 ever you can.” 
 
 I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out 
 in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal 
 lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn’t 
 had a bit to eat since yesterday; so Jim he got out some corn¬ 
 dodgers and butter-milk, and pork and cabbage, and greens— 
 there ain’t nothing in the world so good, when it’s cooked right 
 —and whilst I eat my supper we talked, and had a good time. 
 I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim 
 to get away from the swamp. We said there warn’t no home 
 like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and 
 smothery, but a raft don’t. You feel mighty free and easy and 
 comfortable on a raft.
