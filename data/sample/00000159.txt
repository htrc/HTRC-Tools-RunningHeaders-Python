But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller 
 returns. 
 
 Breathes forth contagion on the world, 
 
 And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i ’ the adage.

 and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place 
 for our show. 
 
 We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there 
 that afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to

 circus would leave before night, so our show would have a 
 pretty good chance. The duke he hired the court house, and we
