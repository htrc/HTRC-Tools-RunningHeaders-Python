I says: 
 
 “I’ll take the canoe and go see, Jim. It mightn’t be, you know.” 
 
 He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in 
 the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I 
 shoved off, he says: 
 
 “Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all on 
 accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef
