to our town, instead, of letting well alone—and so on and soon, 
 till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out 
 what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on 
 to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her 
 clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding 
 the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap 
 and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at 
 last she got down to where I was murdered. I says: 
 
 “Who done it? We’ve heard considerable about these goings 
 on, down in Hookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas that 
 killed Huck Film.” 
 
 “Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people here 
 that’d like to know who killed him. Some thinks old Film done

 Jim.”

 noticed I had put in at all. 
 
 “The nigger run off the very night Huck Firm was killed. So 
 there’s a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. And there’s 
 a reward out for old Finn too—two hundred dollars. You see, 
 he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about 
 it, and was out with ’em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away 
 after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but 
 he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger 
 was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock 
 the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you 
 see, and while they was full of it, next day back comes old Finn 
 and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt 
 for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge give him some, 
 and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight
