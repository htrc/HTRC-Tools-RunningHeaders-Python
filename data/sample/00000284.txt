“Blame it, can’t you try ? I only want you to try—you needn’t 
 keep it up if it don’t work.” 
 
 “But de trouble all done, ef de snake bite me while I’s a-tryin’ 
 him. Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ anything ’at ain’t 
 onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah 
 for me to tame, I’s gwyne to leave, dat’s shore” 
 
 “Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bullheaded about 
 it. We can get you some garter-snakes and you can tie some 
 buttons on their tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I reckon 
 that’ll have to do.”
