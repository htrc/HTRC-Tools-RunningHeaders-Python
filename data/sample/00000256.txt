was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out 
 of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here 
 was a boy that was respectable, and well brung up; and had a 
 character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he 
 was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignor¬ 
 ant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any 
 more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, 
 and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before every¬ 
 body. I couldn't understand it, no way at all. It was outrageous, 
 and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his 
 true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was, and 
 save himself. And I did start to tell him; but he shut me up, and 
 says: 
 
 “Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about? Don’t I generly 
 know what I’m about?” 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “Didn’t I say I was going to help steal the nigger?” 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “ Well , then.” 
 
 That’s all he said, and that’s all I said. It warn’t no use to say 
 any more; because when he said he’d do a tiling, he always done 
 it. But I couldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this 
 thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. 
 If he was bound to have it so, I couldn’t help it. 
 
 When we got home, the house was all dark and still; so we 
 went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper, for to examine it. 
 We went through the yard, so as to see what the hounds would 
 do. They knowed us, and didn’t make no more noise than 
 country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the 
 night. When we got to the cabin, we took a look at the front 
 and the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with— 
 which was the north side—we found a square window-hole up, 
 tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says: 
 
 “Here’s the ticket. This hole’s big enough for Jim to get 
 through, if we wrench off the board.”
