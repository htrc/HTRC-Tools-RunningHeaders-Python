and laughed at him, and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said 
 he’d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but 
 he couldn’t wait now, because he’d come to town to kill old 
 Colonel Sherbum, and his motto was, ‘‘Meat first, and spoon 
 vittles to top off on.” 
 
 He see me, and rode up and says: 
 
 "Whar’d you comef’m, boy? You prepared to die?” 
 
 Then he rode on. I was scared; but a man says: 
 
 “He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a carryin’ on Like that,

 Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; 
 nobody stirred, and there warn’t no more laughing. Boggs rode

 the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the
