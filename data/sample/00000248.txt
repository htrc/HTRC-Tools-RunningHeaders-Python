towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a 
 quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn’t let on to 
 know me, at first.” 
 
 I says: 
 
 “All right; but wait a minute. There’s one more tiling—a tiling 
 that nobody don’t know but me. And that is, there’s a nigger here 
 that I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery—and his name is Jim 
 —old Miss Watson’s Jim.” 
 
 He says: 
 
 “What! Why Jim is-” 
 
 He stopped, and went to studying. I says:

 I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old 
 gentleman was at the door, and he says: 
 
 “Why this is wonderful. Who ever would have thought it 
 was in that mare to do it. I wish we’d a timed her. And she 
 hain’t sweated a hair—not a hair. It’s wonderful. Why, I wouldn’t 
 take a hundred dollars for that horse now; I wouldn’t, honest;
