“It’s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. 
 Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won’t have it. 
 I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school 
 I’ll tan you good. First you know you’ll get religion, too. I never 
 see such a son.” 
 
 He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and 
 a boy, and says: 
 
 “What’s this?” 
 
 “It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.” 
 
 He tore it up, and says: 
 
 “I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a cowhide.” 
 
 He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then 
 he says: 
 
 “ Ain't you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bed¬ 
 clothes; and a look’n-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor— 
 and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. 
 I never see such a son. I bet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ 
 you before I’m done with you. Why, there ain’t no end to your 
 airs—they say you’re rich. Hey?—how’s that?” 
 
 “They lie—that’s how.” 
 
 “Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about 
 all I can stand, now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve been in town 
 two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich. 
 I heard about it away down the river, too. That’s why I come. 
 You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.” 
 
 “I hain’t got no money.” 
 
 “It’s a lie. Judge Thatcher’s got it. You git it. I want it.” 
 
 “I hain’t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; 
 he’ll tell you the same.” 
 
 “All right. I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him pungle, too, or I’ll 
 know the reason why. Say—how much you got in your pocket? 
 I want it.” 
 
 “I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to-” 
 
 “It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you just 
 shell it out.”
