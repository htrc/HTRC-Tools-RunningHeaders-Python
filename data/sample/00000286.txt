“She'll die on my han’s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; lease 1 
 doan’ skasely ever cry.” 
 
 So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said 
 Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. 
 He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one,

 with him; and said he was j ust loadcned down with more gaudier 
 chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name 
 for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, 
 and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, 
 and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom 
 shoved for bed.

 a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing 
 what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took 
 and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two 
 hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome
