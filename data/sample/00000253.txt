said he would tell the people; so I reckon they’ve drove the 
 owdacious loafers out of town before this time.” 
 
 So there it was!—but I couldn’t help it. Tom and me was to 
 sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good 
 night and went up to bed, right after supper, and dumb out of 
 the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the 
 town; for I didn’t believe anybody was going to give the king 
 and the duke a hint, and so, if I didn’t hurry up and give them 
 one they’d get into trouble sure. 
 
 On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned 
 I was murdered, and how pap disappeared, pretty soon, and 
 didn’t come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim

 rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any hardness against 
 them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see.

 We see we was too late—couldn’t do no good. We asked some 
 stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show 
 looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor 
 old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then 
 somebody gave a signal, and the house rose up and went for 
 them. 
 
 So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash 
 as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame
