“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your 
 dinner with us; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to 
 Nichols’s.” 
 
 “Oh, I can’t make you so much trouble, I couldn’t think of it. 
 I’ll walk—I don’t mind the distance.” 
 
 “But we won’t let you walk—it wouldn’t be Southern hos¬ 
 pitality to do it. Come right in.” 
 
 “Oh, do,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not 
 a bit in the world. You must stay. It’s a long, dusty three mile, 
 and we can’t let you walk. And besides, I’ve already told ’em to 
 put on another plate, when I see you coming; so you mustn’t 
 disappoint us. Come right in, and make yourself at home.” 
 
 So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let 
 himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in, he said 
 he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and Iris name was 
 William Thompson—and he made another bow. 
 
 Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicks¬ 
 ville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little 
 nervious, and wondering how this was going to help me out of 
 my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and 
 kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again 
 in his chair, comfortable, and was going on talking; but she 
 jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says: 
 
 “You owdacious puppy!” 
 
 He looked kind of hurt, and says: 
 
 “I’m surprised at you, ma’am.” 
 
 “Your’re s’rp- Why, what do you reckon I am? I’ve a 
 
 good notion to take and—say, what do you mean by kissing 
 me?” 
 
 He looked kind of humble, and says: 
 
 “I didn’t mean nothing, ma’am. I didn’t mean no harm. I—I— 
 thought you’d like it.” 
 
 “Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning-stick, and it 
 looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a 
 crack with it. “What made you think I’d like it?”
