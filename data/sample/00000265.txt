of the nigger p atch and eat it; and he made me go and give the 
 niggers a dime, vvithout telling them what it was for. Tom said 
 that what he mean t was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, 
 I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to 
 get out of prison witih, there’s where the difference was. He said 
 if I’d wanted it to hide- a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill 
 the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, 
 though I couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner, 
 if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions 
 like that, every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon. 
 
 Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody 
 was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the 
 yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood 
 off a piece to keep watch. By and by he come out, and we went 
 and set dov n on the wood-pile, to talk. He says: 
 
 “Everything’s all right, now, except tools; and that’s easy 
 fixed.” 
 
 “Tools?” I says. 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “Tools for what?” 
 
 “Why, to dig with. We ain’t a-going to gnaw him out, are 
 we?” 
 
 “Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in tiicrc good 
 enough to dig a nigger out with?” I says. 
 
 He turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry, 
 and says: 
 
 “Huck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and 
 shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig 
 himself out with? Now I want to ask you—if you got any reason¬ 
 ableness in you at all—what kind of a show would that give him 
 to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key, and done 
 with it. Picks and shovels—why they wouldn’t furnish ’em to a 
 king.” 
 
 “Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks and shovels, 
 what do we want?”
