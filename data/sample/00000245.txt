warn’t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to 
 stand from under when the lightning struck. 
 
 I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he 
 come in, and then the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for 
 him and says: 
 
 “Has he come?” 
 
 “No,” says her husband. 
 
 “Good-ness gracious!” she says, “what in the world can have 
 become of him?” 
 
 “I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say, 
 it makes me dreadful uneasy.” 
 
 “Uneasy!” she says, “I’m ready to go distracted! He must a 
 come; and you’ve missed him along the road. I know it’s so— 
 something teJIs me so.” 
 
 “Why, Sally, I couldn't miss him along the road —you know 
 that.” 
 
 “But oh, dear, dear, what will Sis say! He must a come! You 
 must a missed him. He-” 
 
 “Oh, don’t distress me any more’ll I’m already distressed. I 
 don’t know what in the world to make of it. I’m at my wits’ 
 end, and I don’t mind acknowledging’t I’m right down scared. 
 But there’s no hope that he’s come! for he couldn’t come and me 
 miss him. Sally, it’s terrible—just terrible—something’s happened 
 to the boat, sure!” 
 
 “Why, Silas! Look yonder!—up the road!—ain’t that some¬ 
 body coming?” 
 
 He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that 
 give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down 
 quick, at the foot of the bed, and give me a pull, and out I come; 
 and when he turned back from the window, there she stood, 
 a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty 
 meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says: 
 
 “Why, who’s that?” 
 
 “Who do you reckon ’tis?” 
 
 “I hain’t no idea. Who is it?”
