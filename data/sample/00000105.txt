But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up 
 the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spin¬ 
 ning down a big bend stem first. First I didn’t know where I was; 
 I thought I was dreaming; and when things begun to come back 
 to me, they seemed to come up dim out of last week. 
 
 It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the 
 thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a sohd wall, as well as 
 I could see, by the stars. I looked away down stream, and seen 
 a black speck on the water. I took out after it; but when I got to 
 it it warn’t nothing but a couple of saw-logs made fast together. 
 Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this 
 time 1 was right. It was the raft. 
 
 When I got to it Jim was sitting there with his head down 
 between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the 
 steering oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was 
 littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she’d had a 
 rough time. 
 
 I made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and 
 begun to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says: 
 
 “Hallo, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn’t you stir me 
 up?” 
 
 “Good gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain’ dead—you 
 ain’ drownded—you’s back again? It’s too good for true, honey, 
 it’s too good for true. Lemme look at you, chile, lemme feel o’ 
 you. No, you ain’ dead! you’s back agin’, live en soun’, jis de 
 same ole Huck—de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!” 
 
 “What’s the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?” 
 
 “Drinkin’? Has I ben a-drinkin’? Has I had a chance to be 
 a-drinkin’?” 
 
 “Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?” 
 
 “How does I talk wild?” 
 
 “ How? why, hain’t you been talking about my coming back, 
 and all that stuff, as if I’d been gone away?” 
 
 “Huck—Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de 
 eye. Haiti’t you ben gone away?”
