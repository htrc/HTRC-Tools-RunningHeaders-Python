“Did I give you the letter?” 
 
 “What letter?” 
 
 “The one I got yesterday out of the post office.” 
 
 “No, you didn’t give me no letter.” 
 
 “Well, I must a forgot it.” 
 
 So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres 
 where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.
