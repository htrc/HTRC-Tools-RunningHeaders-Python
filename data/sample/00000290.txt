“Why, Tom, that’ll make trouble next morning; because of 
 course she prob’bly hain’t got any but that one.” 
 
 “I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry 
 the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.” 
 
 “All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy 
 in my own togs.” 
 
 “You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl, then, would you?”

 Next night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood, 
 of a skull and crossbones, on the front door; and next night
