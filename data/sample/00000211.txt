scallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I was here. I 
 could swear they was beats and bummers, that’s all; though that’s 
 worth something. Well, there’s others can do that better than 
 what I can—and they’re people that ain’t going to be doubted 
 as quick as I’d be. I’ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil 
 and a piece of paper. There —‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put

 “Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then 
 I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.” 
 
 “ ’Deed, that ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no 
 manner of means; go before breakfast.” 
 
 “Why?” 
 
 “What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss 
 Mary?” 
 
 “Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don’t know.
