“A couple of case-knives.” 
 
 “To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?” 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.” 
 
 “It don’t make no difference how foolish it j S) it’s the right way 
 —and it’s the regular way. And there ain’t no other way, that 
 ever I heard of, and I’ve read all the books that gives any in¬ 
 formation about these tilings. They ahvays dig out with a case- 
 knife—and not through dirt, mind you; generly it’s through solid 
 rock. And it takes them weeks and. weeks and weeks, and for 
 ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom 
 dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbour of Marseilles, that 
 dug himself out that way; how long was he at it, you reckon?” 
 
 “I don’t know.” 
 
 “Well, guess.” 
 
 “I don’t know. A month and a half?” 
 
 “ Thirty-seven year —and he come out in China. That's the kind. 
 I wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.”

 you stick to the main point?” 
 
 “All right— I don’ t care where he comes out, so he comes out; 
 and Jim don’t either, I reckon. But there’s one thing, anyway— 
 Jim’s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won’t last.” 
 
 “Yes he will last too. You don’t reckon it’s going to take 
 thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?” 
 
 “How long will it take, Tom?” 
 
 “Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it 
 mayn’t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there 
 by New Orleans. He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there. Then his next 
 move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we 
 can’t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By
