dogs went for it, and in two seconds lie was out himself and back 
 again and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door 
 too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and 
 petting him, and asking him if he’d been imagining he saw some¬ 
 thing again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says: 
 
 “Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t believe I see most 
 a million dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah 
 in dese tracks. I did, mos’ sholy. Mars Sid, l felt um —l felt uni, 
 sah; dey was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis’ wisht I could git my 
 han’s on one er dem witches jis’ wunst—on’yjis’ wunst—it’s all 
 I’d ast. But mos’ly I wisht dey’d lemme ’lone, I does.” 
 
 Tom says: 
 
 “Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here 
 just at this runaway nigger’s breakfast-time? It’s because they’re 
 hungry; that’s the reason. You make them a witch pie; that’s the 
 thing for you to do.” 
 
 “But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to mak’em a witch 
 pie? I doan’ know how to make it. I hain’t ever hearn er sich a 
 tiling b’fo’.” 
 
 “Well, then, I’ll have to make it myself.” 
 
 “Will you do it, honey?—will you? I’ll wusshup dc groun’ 
 und’ yo’ foot, I will!” 
 
 “All right, I’ll do it seeing it’s you, and you’ve been good to 
 us and showed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty 
 careful. When we come around, you turn your back; and then 
 whatever we’ve put in the pan, don’t you let on you see it at 
 all. And don’t you look, when Jim unloads the pan—something 
 might happen, I don’t know what. And above all, don’t you 
 handle the witch-tliings.” 
 
 “Hamel’ m, Mars Sid? What is you talkin’ ’bout? I wouldn’ 
 lay de weight er my finger on um, not f’r ten hund’d thous’n’ 
 billion dollars, I wouldn’t.”
