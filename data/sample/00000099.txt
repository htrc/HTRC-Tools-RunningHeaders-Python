with the parlyment; and if everybody don’t go just so he whacks 
 their heads off. But mostly they hang round the harem.” 
 
 “Roun’ de which ? ” 
 
 “Harem.” 
 
 “What’s de harem?” 
 
 “The place where he keeps his wives. Don’t you know about 
 the harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.” 
 
 “Why, yes, dat’s so; I—I’d done forgot it. A harem’s a bo’d’n- 
 house, I reck’n. Mos’ likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. 
 En I reck’n de wives quarrels considable; en dat ’crease de 
 racket. Yit dey say Sollermun de wises’ man dat ever live’. I doan’ 
 take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to hve 
 in de mids’ er sich a blimblammin’ all de time? No—'’deed he 
 wouldn’t. A wise man ’ud take en buil’ a biler-factry; en den he 
 could shet down de biler-factry when he want to res’.” 
 
 “Well, but he was the wisest man, anyway; because the widow 
 she told me so, her own self.” 
 
 “I doan k’yer what de widder say, he wartit no wise man, 
 nuther. He had some er de dad-fetchedes’ ways I ever see. Does 
 you know ’bout dat chile dat he ’uz gwyne to chop in two?” 
 
 “Yes, the widow told me all about it.” 
 
 “Well, den! Warn’ dat de beatenes’ notion in de worl’? You 
 jes’ take en look at it a minute. Dah’s de stump, dah—dat’s one 
 er de women; heah’s you—dat’s de yuther one; I’s Sollermun; 
 en dish-yer dollar bill’s de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What 
 does I do? Does I shin aroun’ mongs’ de neighbours en fine out 
 which un you de bill do b’long to, en han’ it over to de right one, 
 all safe en soun’, de way dat anybody dat had any gumption 
 would? No—I take en whack de bill in two, en give half un it to 
 you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat’s de way Sol¬ 
 lermun was gwyne to do wid de civile. Now I want to ast you: 
 what’s de use er dat half a bill?—can’t buy noth’n wid it. En what 
 use is a half a chile? I would’n give a dern for a million un urn.” 
 
 “But hang it, Jim, you’ve clean missed the point—blame it, 
 you’ve missed it a thousand mile.”
