“Shucks, and. stay fooling around here when we could all be 
 having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out 
 whether Mary Jane’s got it or not? Why, you talk like a 
 muggins.” 
 
 “Well, anyway, maybe you better tell some of the neigh¬ 
 bours.” 
 
 “Listen at that, now. You do beat all, for natural stupidness.
