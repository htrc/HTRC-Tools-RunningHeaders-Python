 EXPLANATORY 
 
 In this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri negro 
 dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods South-Western dialect; 
 the ordinary “ Pike-County” dialect; and four modified varieties of this 
 last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by 
 guess-work; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and 
 support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech. 
 
 I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers 
 would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and 
 not succeeding. 
 
 THE AUTHOR.
