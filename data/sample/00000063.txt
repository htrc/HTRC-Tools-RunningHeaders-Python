and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, 
 stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck, 
 somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. But by and by, sure 
 enough, I catched a glimpse of fire, away through the trees. I 
 went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to 
 have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me 
 the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and Iris head was 
 nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about 
 six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting 
 grey daylight, now. Pretty soon he gapped, and stretched him¬ 
 self, and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I 
 bet I was glad to see him. I says: 
 
 “Hallo, Jim!” and skipped out. 
 
 He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down 
 on his knees, and puts his hands together and says: 
 
 “Doan’ hurt me—don’t! I hain’t ever done no harm to a ghos’. 
 I awluz liked dead people, en done all I could for ’em. You go 
 en git in de river agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do nufFn’ to 
 Ole Jim, ’at ’uz awluz yo’ fren’.” 
 
 Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead. I 
 was ever so glad to see Jim. I wam’t lonesome, now. I told him 
 I warn’t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked 
 along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. 
 Then I says: 
 
 “It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire 
 good.” 
 
 “What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbrics 
 en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den we kin git 
 sumfn’ better den strawbries.” 
 
 “Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live 
 
 V J 
 
 on? 
 
 “I couldn’ git nuffn’ else,” he says. 
 
 “Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?” 
 
 “I come heah de night arter you’s killed.” 
 
 “What, all that time?”
