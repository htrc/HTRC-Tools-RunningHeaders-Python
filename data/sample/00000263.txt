it, all right, let him have it; because I don’t wish to go back on 
 no regulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer—if we go to 
 tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope-ladder, we’re going to 
 get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re born. 
 Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don’t cost 
 nothing, and don’t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up 
 a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag-ladder you can 
 start; and as for Jim, he ain’t had no experience, and so he don’t 
 care what kind of a-” 
 
 “Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you, I’d keep 
 still—that’s what I'd do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner 
 escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.”

 my advice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothes-line.” 
 
 He said that would do. And that give him another idea, and

 “Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make 
 him a better one; and quicker, too.” 
 
 “Prisoners don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep 
 to pull pens out of, you muggins. They always make their pens 
 out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass 
 candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; 
 and it takes them weeks and weeks, and months and months to 
 file it out, too, because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the 
 wall. They wouldn’t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain’t 
 regular.” 
 
 “Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?” 
 
 “Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the
