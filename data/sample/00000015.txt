gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and 
 a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and 
 thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and 
 a fish-line as thick as my little finger, with some monstrous 
 hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, 
 and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have 
 no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a toler¬ 
 able good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle- 
 bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but 
 barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long 
 for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t find the 
 other one, though we hunted all round. 
 
 And so, take it all round, we made a good haul. 
 
 This is the sort of list that a boy reader should pore over with 
 delight; but the paragraph performs other functions of which the 
 boy reader would be unaware. It provides the right counterpoise 
 to the horror of the wrecked house and the corpse; it has a grim 
 precision which tells the reader all he needs to know about the 
 way of life of the human derelicts who had used the house; and 
 (especially the wooden leg, and the fruitless search for its mate) 
 reminds us at the right moment of the kinship of mind and the 
 sympathy between the boy outcast from society and the negro 
 fugitive from the injustice of society. __ 
 
 Huck in fact would be incomplete without Jim, who is almost 
 as notable a creation as Huck himself. Huck is the passive observer 
 of men and events, Jim the submissive sufferer from them; and 
 they are equal in dignity .Jr here is no passage in which their 
 relationship is brought out more clearly than the conclusion of 
 the chapter in which, after the two have become separated in the 
 fog, Huck in the canoe and Jim on the raft, Huck, in his impulse 
 of boyish mischief, persuades Jim for a time that the latter had 
 dreamt the whole episode.
