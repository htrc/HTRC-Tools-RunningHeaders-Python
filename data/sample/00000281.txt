“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “Think you might tell a person. 
 What’s a bar sinister?” 
 
 “Oh, I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All the nobility 
 does.” 
 
 That was just his way. If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing 
 to you, he wouldn’t do it. You might pump at him a week, it 
 wouldn’t make no difference. 
 
 He’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started 
 in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to 
 plan out a mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like 
 they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, 
 and read them off, so: 
 
 1. Here a captive heart busted. 
 
 2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world andJriends, fretted out

 them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a 
 lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn’t know how to 
 make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for 
 him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to do but just follow 
 the lines. Then pretty soon he says: 
 
 “Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have 
 log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. 
 We’ll fetch a rock.” 
 
 Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would 
 take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock, he 
 wouldn’t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him
