you out of it. Keep the river road, all the way, and next time you 
 tramp, take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s a rocky 
 one, and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, 
 I reckon.” 
 
 I went up the bank about tifty yards, and then 1 doubled on 
 my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece 
 below the house. I jumped in and was off in a hurry. I went up 
 stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then 
 started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no 
 blinders on, then. When I was about the middle, I hear the clock 
 begin to strike; so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over 
 the water, but clear—eleven. When I struck the head of the 
 island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but 
 I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, 
 and started a good fire there on a high-and-dry spot. 
 
 Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile 
 and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped 
 through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There 
 Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says: 
 
 “Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain’t a minute to lose. 
 They’re after us!” 
 
 Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the 
 way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he 
 was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was 
 on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow 
 cove where she was laid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern 
 the first thing, and didn’t show a candle outside after that. 
 
 I took the canoe out from shore a little piece and took a look, 
 but if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and 
 shadows ain’t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and 
 slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead 
 still, never saying a word.
