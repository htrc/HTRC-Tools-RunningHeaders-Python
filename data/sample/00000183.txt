“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat 
 for?” 
 
 “Because she’s a big’Orleans boat, and I was afeared she 
 mightn’t stop there. When they’re deep they won’t stop for a 
 hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.” 
 
 “Was Peter Wilks well off?” 
 
 “Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s 
 reckoned he^left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.” 
 
 “When did you say he died?”

 I see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. 
 When I got back with the duke, we laid the canoe and then they 
 set down on a log, and the king told him every tiling just like the 
 young fellow had said it—every last word of it. And all the time 
 he was a-doing it, he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he 
 done it pretty well too, for a slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so 
 I ain’t a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then 
 he says:
