we got there, she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set 
 herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of 
 my hands, and says: 
 
 “Now I can have a. good look at you; and laws-a-me, I’ve been 
 hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and 
 it’s come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and 
 more. What’s kep’ you!—boat get aground?” 
 
 “Yes’m—she-” 
 
 “Don’t say yes’m—say Aunt Sally. Where’d she get aground?” 
 
 I didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know
