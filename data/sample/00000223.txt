give in then ! Indeed he wouldn’t. Said it warn’t no fair test. Said 
 his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and 
 hadn’t tried to write —he see William was going to play one of his 
 jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up 
 and went warbling and warbling right along, till he was actually 
 beginning to believe what he was saying, himself— but pretty 
 soon the new old gentleman broke in, and says: 
 
 “I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped 
 to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for 
 burying?” 
 
 “Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We’re 
 both here.” 
 
 Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: 
 
 “Per’aps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his 
 breast?” 
 
 Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or 
 he’d a squshed down hke a bluff bank that the river has cut under, 
 it took him so sudden—and mind you, it was a thing that was 
 calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid 
 one as that without any notice—because how was he going to 
 know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he 
 couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody 
 bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, 
 Now he’ll throw up the sponge—there ain’t no more use. Well, 
 did he? A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t. I reckon he 
 thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so 
 they’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get 
 away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, 
 and says: 
 
 “Mf! It’s a very tough question, ain't it! Yes, sir, I k’n tell you 
 what’s tattooed on his breast. It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow— 
 that’s what it is; and if you don’t look dost, you can’t see it. 
 Noiv what do you say—hey?” 
 
 Well I never see anything like that old blister for clean out- 
 and-out check.
