first? Answer up prompt, now—don’t stop to study over it. 
 Which end gets up first?” 
 
 “The hind end, mum.” 
 
 “Well, then, a horse?” 
 
 “The for’rard end, mum.” 
 
 “Which side of a tree does the most moss grow on?” 
 
 “North side.” 
 
 “It fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them 
 eats with their heads pointed the same direction?”
