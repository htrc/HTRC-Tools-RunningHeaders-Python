CHAPTER XL 
 
 we were feeling pretty good, after breakfast, and took my canoe 
 and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good 
 time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got 
 home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry 
 they didn’t know which end they was standing on, and made us 
 go right oft to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn’t 
 tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the 
 new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed as much 
 about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half upstairs and 
 her back was turned, we slid for the cellar cubboard and loaded 
 up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, 
 and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s 
 dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says: 
 
 “Where’s the butter?” 
 
 “I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.” 
 
 “Well, you left it laid out, then—it ain’t here.” 
 
 “We can get along without it,” I says. 
 
 “We can get along with it, too,” he says; “just you shde down 
 cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod 
 and come along. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to 
 represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to ha like a sheep 
 and shove soon as you get there.” 
 
 So out he went and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, 
 big as a person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab 
 of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started 
 upstairs, very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but 
 here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in 
 my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she 
 see me; and she says: 
 
 “You been down cellar?” 
 
 “Yes’m.” 
 
 “What you been doing down there?”
