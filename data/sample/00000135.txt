over and go to sleep again, when I noticed how still it was— 
 didn’t seem to be anybody stirring. That warn’t usual. Next I 
 noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wonder- 
 ing, and goes downstairs—nobody around; everything as still 
 as a mouse. Just the same outside; thinks I, what does it mean? 
 Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says: 
 
 “What’s it all about?” 
 
 Says he: 
 
 “Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?” 
 
 “No,” says I, “I don’t.” 
 
 “Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! ’deed she has. She run off 
 in de night, some time—nobody don’t know jis’ when—run off 
 to git married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know— 
 leastways, so dey ’spec. De fambly foun’ it out, ’bout half an 
 hour ago—maybe a little mo’—en’ I tell you dey warn’t no time 
 los’. Sich another hurryin’ up guns en hosses you never see! De 
 women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars 
 Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to 
 try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ he kin git acrost 
 de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mighty 
 rough times.” 
 
 “Buck went off’thout waking me up.” 
 
 “Well, I reck’n he didl Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in 
 it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to 
 fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un’m 
 dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a 
 chanst.” 
 
 I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I 
 begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the 
 log store and the wood-pile where the steamboats land, I worked 
 along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then 
 I dumb up into the forks of a cotton-wood that was out of 
 reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high, a 
 little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide 
 behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.
