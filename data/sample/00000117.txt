towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; 
 so I changed off and went that way. 
 
 It was one of these long, slanting, tw o-mile crossings; so I was 
 a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and 
 dumb up the bank. I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went 
 poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, 
 and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log house before 
 I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of 
 dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and 
 I knowed better than to move another peg. 
 
 CHAPTER XVII 
 
 in about half a minute somebody spoke out of a window, with¬ 
 out putting his head out, and says: 
 
 “Be done, boys! Who’s there?’’ 
 
 I says: 
 
 “It’s me.” 
 
 “Who’s me?” 
 
 George Jackson, sir. ” 
 
 “What do you want?” 
 
 “I don’t want nothing, sir. I only w r ant to go along by, but the 
 dogs won’t let me.” 
 
 “What are you prowling around here this time of night, for— 
 hey?” 
 
 “I warn’t prowling around, sir; I fell overboard off of the 
 steamboat.” 
 
 “Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What 
 did you say your name was?” 
 
 “George Jackson, sir. I’m only a boy.” 
 
 “Look here; if you’re telling the truth, you needn’t be afraid 
 —nobody’ll hurt you. But don’t try to budge; stand right where 
 you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the 
 guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?”
