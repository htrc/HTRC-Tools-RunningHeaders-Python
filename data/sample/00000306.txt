the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when 
 they’ve got their satisfaction out of him. 
 
 They cussed Jim considerable, though, and give him a cuff or 
 two, side the head, once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, 
 and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same 
 cabin, and put Iris own clothes on him, and chained him again, 
 and not to no bed-leg, this time, but to a big staple drove into 
 the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and 
 said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to eat, after 
 this, till his owner come or he was sold at auction, because he 
 didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, 
 and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around
