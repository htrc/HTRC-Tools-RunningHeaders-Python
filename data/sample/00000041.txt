ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, 
 and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and 
 then. His hat was laying on the floor; an old black slouch with 
 the top caved in, like a lid. 
 
 I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his 
 chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the 
 window was up; so he had dumb in by the shed. He kept a-look¬ 
 ing me all over. By and by he says: 
 
 “Starchy clothes—very. You think you’re a good deal of a 
 big-bug, don t you?” 
 
 “Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.
