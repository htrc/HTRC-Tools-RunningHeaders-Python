steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one 
 we like the best.” 
 
 What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer’s 
 head, I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steam¬ 
 boat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went 
 to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I 
 knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. 
 Pretty soon, Tom says: 
 
 “Ready?” 
 
 “Yes,” I says. 
 
 “All right—bring it out.” 
 
 “My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it’s Jim in

 ready it wouldn’t have none of them objections to it. 
 
 And it didn’t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute 
 it was worth fifteen of mine, for style, and would make Jim just 
 as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. 
 So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn’t 
 tell what it was, here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way 
 it was. I knowed he would be changing it around, every which 
 way, as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever 
 he got a chance. And that is what he done. 
 
 Well, one thing was dead sure: and that was, that Tom Sawyer
