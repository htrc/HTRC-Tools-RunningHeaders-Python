able trouble?—what you going to do?—how you going to get 
 around it? Jim’s got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They 
 all do.” 
 
 Jim says: 
 
 “Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arms; I hain’t got 
 nuffn but dish-yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de 
 journal on dat.” 
 
 “Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very 
 different.” 
 
 “Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he hain’t 
 got no coat of arms, because he hain’t.” 
 
 “I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have 
 one before he goes out of this—because he’s going out right, and 
 there ain’t going to be no flaws in Inis record.” 
 
 So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat 
 apiece, Jim a-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine 
 out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. 
 By and by he said he’d struck so many good ones he didn’t 
 hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned 
 he’d decide on. He says: 
 
 “On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a 
 saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common 
 charge, and under Inis foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with 
 a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a 
 field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dencette 
 indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his 
 shoulder on a bar sinister: and a couple of gules for supporters, 
 which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it 
 out of a book—means, the more haste, the less speed.” 
 
 “Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?” 
 
 “We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says, “we got 
 to dig in like all git-out.” 
 
 “Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s some of it? What’s a fess?” 
 
 “A fess—a fess is —you don’t need to know what a fess is. I’ll 
 show him how to make it when he gets to it.”
