“Hamlet’s which?” 
 
 “Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in 
 Shakespeare. Ah, it’s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. 
 I haven’t got it in the book—I’ve only got one volume—but I 
 reckon I can piece it out from memory. I’ll just walk up and 
 down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection’s 
 vaults.” 
 
 So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning 
 horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eye¬ 
 brows; next he would squeeze Inis hand on Inis forehead and 
 stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next 
 he’d let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful to see him. By and by 
 he got it. He told us to give attention. Then he strikes a most 
 noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms 
 stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the 
 sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and 
 after that, all through his speech he howled, and spread around, 
 and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any 
 acting ever I see before. This is the speech—I learned it, easy 
 enough, while he was learning it to the king: 
 
 To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin 
 That makes calamity of so long life; 
 
 For who would fardels bear, till Bimam Wood do come to Dunsinane, 
 But that the fear of something after death 
 Murders the innocent sleep, 
 
 Great nature’s second course, 
 
 And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune 
 Than fly to others that we know not of. 
 
 There’s the respect must give us pause: 
 
 Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst; 
 
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
 
 The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, 
 
 The law’s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take, 
 
 In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn 
 In customary suits of solemn black,
