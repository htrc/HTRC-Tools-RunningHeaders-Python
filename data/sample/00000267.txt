really dig in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on, to 
 ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can 
 snatch him out and rush him away the first time there’s an alarm. 
 Yes, I reckon that’ll be the best way.” 
 
 “Now, there’s sense in that,” I says. “Letting on don’t cost 
 nothing; letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t 
 mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn’t 
 strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I’ll mosey along now,

 the middle of the bottom log. Tom said he was right behind 
 Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and when we got 
 through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there was 
 any hole there, because Jim’s counterpin hung down most to the 
 ground, and you’d have to rise it up and look under to see the 
 hole. So we dug and dug, with the case-knives, till most mid¬ 
 night; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, 
 and yet you couldn’t see we’d done anything, hardly. At last I says: 
 
 “This ain’t no thirty-seven-year job, this is a thirty-eight-year 
 job, Tom Sawyer.” 
 
 He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he
