CHAPTER XXXVII 
 
 that was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the 
 rubbage-pile in the back yard where they keep the old boots, 
 and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin tilings, and all 
 such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin wash-pan 
 and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie 
 in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour, and started 
 for breakfast and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said

 whoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it 
 all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter 
 of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half-
