heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just as plain as if the 
 man was by my side. 
 
 There was a little grey in the sky, now; so I stepped into the 
 woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast.

 the sun was up so high when I waked, that I judged it was after 
 eight o’clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade, thinking 
 about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satis¬
