deef and dumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they 
 waited for a steamboat. 
 
 About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come 
 along, but they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but 
 at last there was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her 
 yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and 
 when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile, they 
 was booming mad, and give us a cussing, and said they wouldn’t 
 land us. But the king was calm. He says: 
 
 “If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece, to be

 signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a 
 carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. If they warn’t the beatenest 
 lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck. 
 
 Well, the men gethered around, and sympathized with them, 
 and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet¬
