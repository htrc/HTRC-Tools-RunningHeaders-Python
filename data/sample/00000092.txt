“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning; 
 there’s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up 
 their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows 
 can’t get away from the wreck, there’s one of ’em going to be 
 in a bad fix. But if we fmd their boat we can put all of ’em in 
 a bad fix—for the sheriff’ll get ’em. Quick—hurry! I’ll hunt the

 men stuck his head out, only about a couple of foot from me, and 
 I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:
