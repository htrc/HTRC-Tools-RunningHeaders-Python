nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger 
 that fed Jim—if it was Jim that was being fed. The niggers was 
 just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and 
 Jim’s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and 
 things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the 
 house. 
 
 This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his 
 wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to 
 keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful, 
 these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange tilings, and 
 hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn’t beheve 
 he was ever witched so long, before, in his hfe. He got so worked 
 up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all 
 about what he’d been a-going to do. So Tom says: 
 
 “What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?” 
 
 The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, hke 
 when you heave a brickbat in a mud puddle, and he says: 
 
 “Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go 
 en look at ’im?” 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 I hunched Tom, and whispers: 
 
 “You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.” 
 
 “No, it wam’t—but it’s the plan now.” 
 
 So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t hke it much. When 
 we got in, we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but 
 Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: 
 
 “Why Huckl En good lan ! ain’ dat Misto Tom?” 
 
 I just knowed how it would l?e; I just expected it. I didn’t know 
 nothing to do; and if I had, I couldn’t a done it; because that 
 nigger busted in and says: 
 
 “Why de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?” 
 
 We could see pretty well, now. Tom he looked at the nigger, 
 steady and kind of wondering, and says: 
 
 “Does who know us?” 
 
 “Why, dish-yer runaway nigger.”
