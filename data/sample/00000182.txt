told in it where his money was laid, and how he wanted the rest 
 of the property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right 
 —for George didn’t leave nothing. And that letter was all they 
 could get him to put a pen to.” 
 
 “Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he 
 live?” 
 
 “Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t
