I says: 
 
 “What do we want of a moat, when we’re going to snake him 
 out from under the cabin?” 
 
 But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. 
 He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon, he sighs, and 
 shakes his head; then sighs again, and says: 
 
 “No, it wouldn’t do—there ain’t necessity enough for it.” 
 
 “For what?” I says: 
 
 “Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says. 
 
 “Good land!” I says, “why, there ain’t no necessity for it. And 
 what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”
