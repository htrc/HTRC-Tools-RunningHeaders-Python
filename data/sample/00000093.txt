“All ready—shove off.” 
 
 I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But 
 Bill says: 
 
 “Hold on—’d you go through him?” 
 
 “No. Didn’t you?” 
 
 “No. So he’s got his share o’ the cash, yet.” 
 
 “Well, then, come along—no use to take truck and leave 
 money.” 
 
 “Say—won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?” 
 
 “Maybe he won’t. But we got to have it anyway. Come

 Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.

 dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to 
 myself, there ain’t no telling but I might come to be a murderer 
 myself, yet, and then how would I hke it? So says I to Jim: 
 
 “The first light we see, we’ll land a hundred yards below it or 
 above it, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the
