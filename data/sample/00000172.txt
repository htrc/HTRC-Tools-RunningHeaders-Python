to be took in so, but I wouldn’t a been in that ring-master’s place, 
 not for a thousand dollars. I don’t know; there may be bulher 
 circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. 
 Anyways it was plenty good enough for me ; and wherever I run 
 across it, it can have all of my custom, every time. 
 
 Well, that night we had our show; but there warn’t only about 
 twelve people there; just enough to pay expenses. And they 
 laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and every¬ 
 body left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which 
 was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t 
 come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy— 
 and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he 
 reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he 
 got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, 
 and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the 
 village. The bills said: 
 
 AT THE COURT HOUSE! 
 
 FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY! 
 
 The World-Renowned Tragedians 
 DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER 
 
 AND 
 
 EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER! 
 
 Of the London and Continental 
 Theatres, 
 
 In their Thrilling Tragedy of 
 THE KING’S CAMELOPARD 
 
 OR 
 
 THE ROYAL NONESUCH!!! 
 
 Admission 50 cents. 
 
 Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all—which said: 
 
 LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED 
 
 “There,” says he, “if that line don’t fetch them, I don’t know 
 Arkansaw!”
