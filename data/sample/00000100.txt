“Who? Me? Go ’long. Doan’ talk to me ’bout yo’ pints. I 
 reck’n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain’ no sense in sich 
 doin’s as dat. De ’spute warn’t ’bout a half a chile, de ’spute was 
 ’bout a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a ’spute 
 ’bout a whole chile w T id a half a chile, doan’ know enough to 
 come in out’n de rain. Doan’ talk to me ’bout Sollermun, Huck, 
 I knows him by de back.” 
 
 “But I tell you you don’t get the point.” 
 
 “Blame de pint! I reck’n I knows what I knows. En mine you, 
 de real pint is down furder—it’s down deeper. It lays in de way 
 Sollermun was raised. You take a man dat’s got on’y one er two 
 chillen; is dat man gwyne to be wasteful o’ chillen? No, he ain’t; 
 he can’t ’ford it. He know how to value ’em. But you take a man 
 dat’s got ’bout five million chillen runnin’ roun’ de house, en it’s 
 diffunt. He as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey’s plenty mo’. 
 A child er two, mo’ er less, warn’t no consekens to Sollermun, 
 dad fetch him!” 
 
 I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, 
 there warn’t no getting it out again. He was the most down on 
 Solomon of any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about 
 other kings, and let Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth 
 that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his 
 little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took 
 and shut him up in jail, and some say he died there. 
 
 “Po’ little chap.” 
 
 “But some says he got out and got away, and come to 
 America.” 
 
 “Dat’s good! But he’ll be pooty lonesome—-dey ain’ no 
 kings here, is dey, Huck?” 
 
 “No.” 
 
 “Den he cain’t git no situation. What he gwyne to do?” 
 
 “Well, I don’t know. Some of them gets on the police, and 
 some of them learns people how to talk French.” 
 
 “Why, Huck, doan’ de French people talk de same way we 
 does?”
