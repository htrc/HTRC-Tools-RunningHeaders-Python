chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white 
 gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with 
 her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with 
 the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded 
 across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two 
 more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was, to see 
 which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other 
 arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind 
 made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the 
 bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung 
 flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The 
 young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, 
 but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, 
 seemed to me. 
 
 This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and 
 used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffer¬ 
 ing in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after 
 them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what 
 she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots 
 that fell down a well and was drownded: 
 
 ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEc’d 
 
 And did young Stephen sicken, 
 
 And did young Stephen die? 
 
 And did the sad hearts thicken, 
 
 And did the mourners cry? 
 
 No; such was not the fate of 
 Young Stephen Dowling Bots; 
 
 Though sad hearts round him thickened, 
 
 ’Twas not from sickness’ shots. 
 
 No whooping-cough did rack his frame, 
 
 Nor measles drear, with spots: 
 
 Not these impaired the sacred name 
 Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
