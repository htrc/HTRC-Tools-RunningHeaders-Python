about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a 
 tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you 
 won’t get into trouble with us, d’ye hear?” 
 
 That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. 
 I wanted to be left free to work my plans. 
 
 “So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever 
 you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your 
 nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways I’ve 
 heard there’s such down South here. And when you tell him the 
 handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll believe you when 
 you explain to him what the idea was for getting ’em out. Go 
 ’long, now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you 
 don’t work your jaw any between here and there.” 
 
 So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn’t look around, 
 but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could 
 tire him out at that. I went straight out in the country as much as 
 a mile, before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods 
 towards Phelps’s. I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight 
 off, without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim’s 
 mouth till these fellows could get away. I didn’t want no trouble 
 with their kind. I’d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to 
 get entirely shut of them. 
 
 CHAPTER XXXII 
 
 WHEN I GOT there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sun¬ 
 shiny—the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind 
 of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so 
 lonesome and like everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze 
 fans along and quivers the leaves ; it makes you feel mournful, 
 because you feel like it’s spirits whispering—spirits that’s been 
 dead ever so many years—and you always think they’re talking 
 about you. As a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, 
 too, and done with it all.
