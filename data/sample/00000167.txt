stooping a little, and resting their hands on their thighs to watch 
 him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he 
 stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning 
 and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, 
 “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a dead level, 
 and says “Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and 
 fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing 
 said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all 
 happened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles 
 and treated him. 
 
 Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. 
 In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, 
 mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they 
 come to, to do the hanging with. 
 
 CHAPTER XXII 
 
 they swarmed up the street towards Sherburn’s house, a-whoop- 
 ing and yelling and raging like Injuns, and everything had to 
 clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was 
 awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming 
 and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the 
 road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in 
 every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and 
 as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break 
 and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was 
 crying and taking on, scared most to death. 
 
 They swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as 
 they could jam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for 
 the noise. It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out, “Tear 
 down the fence! tear down the fence!” Then there was a racket 
 of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the 
 front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.
