daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went 
 looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put 
 in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the 
 back way.” 
 
 “Who’d you give the baggage to?” 
 
 “Nobody.” 
 
 “Why, child, it’ll be stole!” 
 
 “Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says. 
 
 “How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?” 
 
 It was kinder thin ice, but I says: 
 
 “The captain see me standing around, and told me I better

 the texas to the officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”

 throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here’s another place 
 where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but 
 she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says: 
 
 “Here he comes! stick your head down lower—there, that’ll 
 do; you can’t be seen, now. Don’t you let on you’re here. I’ll
