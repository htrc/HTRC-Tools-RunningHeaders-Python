CHAPTER. XXI 
 
 it was after sun-up, now, but we went right on, and didn’t tie 
 up. The king and the duke turned out, by and by, looking pretty 
 rusty; but after they’d jumped overboard and took a swim, it 
 chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took 
 a seat on a corner of the raft, and pulled off Pus boots and rolled 
 up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be 
 comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and 
 Juliet by heart. When he had got it pretty good, him and the 
 duke begun to practise it together. The duke had to learn him 
 over and over again, how to say every speech; and he made him 
 sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after while he said he 
 done it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t bellow out 
 Romeo ! that way, like a bull—you must say it soft, and sick, and 
 languishy, so—R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet’s a dear 
 sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she don’t bray like a 
 jackass.” 
 
 Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke 
 made out of oak laths, and begun to practise the sword-fight— 
 the duke called himself Richard III; and the way they laid on 
 and pranced around the raft was grand to see. But by and by the 
 king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, 
 and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they’d had in other 
 times along the river. 
 
 After dinner, the duke says: 
 
 “Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you 
 know, so I guess we’ll add a little more to it. We want a little 
 something to answer encores with, anyway.” 
 
 “What’s onkores, Bilgewater?” 
 
 The duke told him, and then says: 
 
 “I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s horn¬ 
 pipe; and you—well, let me see—oh, I’ve got it—you can do 
 Hamlet’s soliloquy.”
