young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old Harry out o’ both 
 o ye! 
 
 But Tom, he was so proud and joyful, he just couldn't hold in, 
 and his tongue just went it—she a-chipping in, and spitting fire 
 all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat-con¬ 
 vention; and she says: 
 
 “Well, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now, for 
 mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again-” 
 
 “Meddling with who?” Tom says, dropping his smile, and 
 looking surprised. 
 
 “With who ? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who’d you 
 reckon?” 
 
 Tom looks at me very grave, and says: 
 
 “Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn’t he got 
 away?” 
 
 “Him?” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger? ’Deed he 
 hasn’t. They’ve got him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that 
 cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, 
 till he’s claimed or sold!” 
 
 Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils 
 opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me: 
 
 “They hain’t no right to shut him up! Shove! —and don’t you 
 lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain’t no slave; he’s as free as 
 any cretur that walks this earth!” 
 
 “What does the child mean?” 
 
 “I mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t 
 go, I’ll go. I’ve knowed him all Iris life, and so has Tom, there. 
 Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed 
 she ever was going to sell him down the river, and said so; and 
 she set him free in her will.” 
 
 “Then what on earth did you want to set him free for, seeing 
 he was already free?” 
 
 “Well, that is a question, I must say; and just hke women! 
 Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep 
 in blood to—goodness alive— Aunt Polly!”
