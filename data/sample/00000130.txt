kills him ; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one 
 another; then the cousins chip in—and by and by everybody’s 
 killed off, and there ain’t no more feud. But it’s kind of slow, 
 and takes a long time.” 
 
 “Has this one been going on long, Buck?” 
 
 “Well, I should reckonl it started thirty year ago, or som’ers 
 along there. There was trouble ’bout something and then a law¬ 
 suit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he 
 up and shot the man that won the suit—which he would naturally 
 do, of course. Anybody would.”
