them; they come out to see what’s the matter with you. Yes, 
 you’re all right; you’re fixed very well. You want to set on your 
 bed, nights, before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, 
 and play your Jew’s harp; play The Last Link is Broken —that’s 
 the thing that’ll scoop a rat, quicker’n anything else; and when 
 you’ve played about two minutes, you’ll see all the rats, and the 
 snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, 
 and come. And they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a 
 noble good time.” 
 
 “Yes, dey will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is 
 Jim havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll do it ef I got to. 
 I reck’n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble 
 in de house.” 
 
 Tom waited to think over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else; 
 and pretty soon he says: 
 
 “Oh—there’s one tiling I forgot. Could you raise a flower 
 here, do you reckon?” 
 
 “I doan’ know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable 
 dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en she’d 
 be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.” 
 
 “Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.” 
 
 “One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in 
 heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’ be wuth half de 
 trouble she’d coss.” 
 
 “Don’t you believe it. We’ll fetch you a little one, and you 
 plant it in the corner, over there, and raise it. And don’t call it 
 mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name, when it’s in 
 a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.” 
 
 “Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.” 
 
 “You don’t want spring water; you want to water it with your 
 tears. It’s the way they always do.” 
 
 “Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks 
 twyste wid spring water whiles another man’s a -start n one wid 
 tears. 
 
 “That ain’t the idea. You got to do it with tears.”
