ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trou ble for that 
 gang, for not many would a done it. I wished the widow knowed 
 about it. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rap¬ 
 scallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the 
 widow and good people takes the most interest in. 
 
 Well, before long, here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, 
 sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and

 clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a 
 spy-glass, and three boxes of seegars. We hadn’t ever been this 
 rich before, in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We
