CHAPTER XXXIII 
 
 SO I STARTED for town, in the wagon, and when I was half-way 
 I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and 
 I stopped and waited till he come along. I says, “Hold on!” and 
 it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened like a trunk, and 
 stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person 
 that’s got a dry throat, and then says: 
 
 “I hain’t ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, 
 what you want to come back and ha’nt me for?” 
 
 I says:

 off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and 
 what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a 
 minute, and don’t disturb him. So he thought and thought, and 
 pretty soon he says: 
 
 “It’s all right, I’ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and 
 let on it’s yourn; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as 
 to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I’ll go
