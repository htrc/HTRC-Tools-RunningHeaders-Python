“Well, den, she ain’t got no business to talk like either one er 
 the yuther of ’em. Is a Frenchman a man?” 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “ Well, den! Dad blame it, why doan’ he talk like a man? You 
 answer me dat \” 
 
 I see it warn’t no use wasting words—you can’t learn a nigger 
 to argue. So I quit. 
 
 CHAPTER XV 
 
 we judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the 
 bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that 
 was what we was after. We would sell the raft and get on a 
 steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and 
 then be out of trouble. 
 
 Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made 
 for a tow-head to tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in fog; 
 but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line, to make 
 fast, there warn’t anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed 
 the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, 
 but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down 
 so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see 
 the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn’t 
 budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me—and then there 
 warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twenty yards. I jumped 
 into the canoe and run back to the stem and grabbed the paddle 
 and set her back a stroke. But she didn’t come. I was in such a 
 hurry I hadn’t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I 
 was so excited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything 
 with them. 
 
 As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, 
 right down the tow-head. That was all right as far as it went, 
 but the tow-head warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew 
 by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no 
 more idea which way I was going than a dead man.
