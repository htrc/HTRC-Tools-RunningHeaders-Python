Phelps’s was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations; 
 and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile, 
 made out of logs sawed off and up-ended, in steps, like barrels 
 of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the 
 women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; 
 some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare 
 and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double 
 log house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the chinks 
 stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been 
 whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a 
 big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log 
 smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins 
 in a row t’other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself 
 away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down 
 a piece the other side; ash-hopper, and big kettle to bile soap in, 
 by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water 
 and a gourd; hound asleep there, in the sun; more hounds asleep, 
 round about; about three shade-trees away off in a corner; some 
 currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; 
 outside of the fence a garden and a water melon patch; then the 
 cotton fields begins; and after the fields, the woods. 
 
 I went around and dumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, 
 and started for the kitchen. When I got a little ways, I heard the 
 dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along 
 down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead 
 —for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world. 
 
 I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just 
 trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when 
 the time come; for I’d noticed that Providence always did put the 
 right words in my mouth, if I left it alone. 
 
 When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up 
 and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and 
 kept still. And such another pow-wow as they made! In a quarter 
 of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say 
 —spokes made out of dogs—circle of fifteen of them packed
