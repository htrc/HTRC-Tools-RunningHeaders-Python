to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I 
 wouldn’t give him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger 
 stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was 
 good, he whispers to Jim, and says: 
 
 “Don’t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging 
 going on night, it’s us: we’re going to set you free.” 
 
 Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it, then
