go and face your uncles, when they come to kiss you good 
 morning, and never-” 
 
 “There, there, don’t! Yes, I'll go before breakfast—I’ll be glad 
 to. And leave my sisters with them?” 
 
 “Yes—never mind about them. They’ve got to stand it yet a 
 while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. 
 I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in 
 this town—if a neighbour was to ask how is your uncles this 
 morning, your face would tell something. No, you go right 
 along, Miss Maryjane, and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tell Miss 
 Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you’ve went 
 away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see 
 a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in the morning.” 
 
 “Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love 
 given to them.” 
 
 “Well, then, it shan’t be.” It was well enough to tell her so— 
 no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; 
 and it’s the little tilings that smooths people’s roads the most, 
 down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and 
 it wouldn’t cost nothing. Then I says: “There’s one more thing 
 —that bag of money.” 
 
 “Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to 
 think how they got it.” 
 
 “No, you’re out, there. They hain’t got it.” 
 
 “Why, who’s got it?” 
 
 “I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I had it, because I stole it from 
 them: and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, 
 but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary 
 Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; 
 I did, honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it 
 into the first place I come to, and run—and it warn’t a good 
 place.” 
 
 “Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t 
 allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault. Where did 
 you hide it?”
