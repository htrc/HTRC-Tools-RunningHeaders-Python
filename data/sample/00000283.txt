“You got any spiders in here, Jim?” 
 
 “No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.” 
 
 “All right, we’ll get you some.” 
 
 “But bless you, honey, I doan’ want none. I’s afeard un um. 
 I jis’ ’s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.” 
 
 Tom thought a minute or two, and says: 
 
 “It’s a good idea. And I reckon it’s been done. It must a been 
 done; it stands to reason. Yes, it’s a prime good idea. Where 
 could you keep it?” 
 
 “Keep what, Mars Tom?” 
 
 “Why, a rattlesnake.” 
 
 “De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a 
 rattlesnake to come in heah, I’d take en bust right out thoo dat 
 log wall, I would, wid my head.” 
 
 “Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it, after a little. You 
 could tame it.” 
 
 “Tame it!” 
 
 “Yes—easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and 
 petting, and they wouldn’t think of hurting a person that pets 
 them. Any book will tell you that. You try—that’s all I ask; just 
 try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little 
 while, that he’ll love you; and sleep with you; and won’t stay 
 away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your 
 neck and put his head in your mouth.” 
 
 “Please, Mars Tom —doan talk so! I can’t stan it! He’d let me 
 shove his head in my mouf—fer a favour, hain’t it? I lay he’d 
 wait a pow’ful long time ’fo’ I ast him. En mo’ en dat, I doan’ 
 want him to sleep wid me.” 
 
 “Jim, don’t act so foolish. A prisoner’s got to have some kind 
 of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever been tried, why, 
 ther’s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try 
 it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.” 
 
 “Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ want no sich glory. Snake take ’n 
 bite Jim’s chin off, den whah is de glory! No, sah, I doan’ want no 
 sich doin’s.”
