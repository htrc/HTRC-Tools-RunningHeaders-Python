judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge 
 said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife 
 she cried again; pap said he’d been a man that had always been 
 misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. The old 
 man said that what a man wanted that was down, was sympathy; 
 and the judge said it was so; so they cried again. And when it was 
 bedtime, the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says: 
 
 “Look at it, gentlemen, and ladies all; take ahold of it; shake it. 
 There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no 
 more; it’s the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll 
 die before he’ll go back. You mark them words—don’t forget I 
 said them. It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t be afeard.” 
 
 So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. 
 The judge’s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a 
 pledge—made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time 
 on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man 
 into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the 
 night some time he got powerful thirsty and dumb out on to 
 the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new 
 coat for a jug of forty-rod, and dumb back again and had a good 
 old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as 
 a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two 
 places and was most froze to death when somebody found him 
 after sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room, 
 they had to take soundings before they could navigate it. 
 
 The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body 
 could reform the ole man with a shot-gun, maybe, but he didn’t 
 know no other way. 
 
 CHAPTER VI 
 
 well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and 
 then he went forjudge Thatcher in the courts to make him give 
 up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school.
