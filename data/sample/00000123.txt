They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons 
 and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called 
 “ Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called 
 crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her 
 own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different 
 from any pictures I ever see before; blacker, mostly, than is 
 common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small 
 under the arm-pits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of 
 the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black 
 veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and 
 very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive 
 on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, 
 and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white hand¬

 with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and 
 knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was 
 crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back 
 in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it 
 said, “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas!” 
 There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up 
 at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had 
 an open letter in one hand with a black sealing-wax showing on 
 one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it 
 against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said, “And Art 
 Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas!” These was all nice pic¬ 
 tures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to them, 
 because if ever I was down a little, they always gave me the fan- 
 tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a 
 lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what 
 she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned, that with her 
 disposition, she was having a better time in the graveyard. She 
 was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when 
 she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to 
 be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the
