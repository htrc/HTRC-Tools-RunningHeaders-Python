and a roundabout and pants of Inis, and I put them on. While I 
 was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell 
 him, he started to telling me about a blue jay and a young rabbit 
 he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked 
 me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn’t 
 know; I hadn’t heard about it before, no way. 
 
 “Well, guess,” he says.
