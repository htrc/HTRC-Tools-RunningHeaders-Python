fool, and the king begun to sass back; and the minute they was 
 fairly at it, I lit out, and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and 
 spun down the river road like a deer—for I see our chance; and 
 I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever 
 see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but 
 loaded up with joy, and sung out: 
 
 “Set her loose, Jim, we’re all right, now!” 
 
 But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wig¬ 
 wam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and 
 then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, 
 whooping and screeching; but it warn’t no use—old Jim was 
 gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it. But I couldn’t 
 set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to drink 
 what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him 
 if he’d seen a strange nigger, dressed so and so, and he says: 
 
 “Yes.” 
 
 “Whereabouts?” says I. 
 
 “Down to Silas Phelps’s place, two mile below here. He’s a 
 runaway nigger, and they’ve got him. Was you looking for 
 him?” 
 
 “You bet I ain’t. I run across him in the woods about an hour 
 or two ago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out—and 
 told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been 
 there ever since; afeard to come out.” 
 
 “Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more, becuz 
 they’ve got him. He run f’m down South, sonr’ers.” 
 
 “It’s a good job they got him.” 
 
 “Well, I rcckonl There’s two hundred dollars reward on him. 
 It’s like picking up money out’n the road.” 
 
 “Yes, it is—and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see 
 him first. Who nailed him?” 
 
 “It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his chance 
 in him for forty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river and 
 can’t wait. Think o’ that, now! You bet I'd wait, if it was seven 
 year.”
