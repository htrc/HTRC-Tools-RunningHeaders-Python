“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but 
 mostly it’s considered best to kill them. Except some that you 
 bring to the cave here and keep them till they’re ransomed.” 
 
 “Ransomed? What’s that?” 
 
 “I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve seen it in books; 
 and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do.” 
 
 “But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?” 
 
 “Why blame it all, we’ve got to do it. Don’t I tell you it’s in 
 the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what’s 
 in the books, and get tilings all muddled up?” 
 
 “Oh, that’s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the 
 nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know 
 how to do it to them? that’s the thing I want to get at. Now what 
 do you reckon it is?” 
 
 “Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them till they’re 
 ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re dead.” 
 
 “Now, that’s something like. That’ll answer. Why couldn’t 
 you said that before? We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to 
 death—and a bothersome lot they’ll be, too, eating up everything 
 and always trying to get loose.” 
 
 “How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when 
 there’s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they 
 move a peg?” 
 
 “A guard. Well, that is good. So somebody’s got to set up all 
 night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think 
 that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom 
 them as soon as they get here?” 
 
 “Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why. Now, Ben 
 Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s 
 the idea. Don’t you reckon that the people that made the books 
 knows what’s the correct tiling to do? Do you reckon you can 
 learn ’em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go 
 on and ransom them in the regular way.” 
 
 “All right. I don’t mind; but 1 say it’s a fool way, anyhow. 
 Say—do we kill the women, too?”
