yesterday. He never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on 
 me and says: 
 
 “Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We’d skin 
 him if he done that!” 
 
 “How can he blow? Hain’t he run off?” 
 
 “No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and 
 the money’s gone.” 
 
 “Sold him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was my nigger, 
 and that was my money. Where is he?—I want my nigger.” 
 
 “Well, you can’t get your nigger, that’s all—so dry up your 
 blubbering. Looky here—do you think youd venture to blow 
 on us? Blamed if I think I’d trust you. Why, if you teas to blow

 “A farmer by the name of Silas Ph-” and then he stopped. 
 
 You see he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped, that 
 way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was 
 changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me; he 
 wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole 
 three days. So pretty soon he says: “The man that bought him 
 is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and he lives forty 
 mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.” 
 
 “All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I’ll start 
 this very afternoon.” 
 
 “No you won’t, you’ll start now; and don’t you lose any time
