holts and made that rush to get a look, we’d a slept in our 
 cravats to-night—cravats warranted to wear, too—longer than 
 we’d need ’em.” 
 
 They was still a minute—thinking—then the king says, kind 
 of absent-minded like: 
 
 ‘‘Mf! And we reckoned the niggers stole it!” 
 
 That made me squirm! 
 
 “Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow, and deliberate, and sarcastic 
 “we did.” 
 
 After about a half a minute, the king drawls out: 
 
 “Leastways —I did.” 
 
 The duke says, the same way: 
 
 “On the contrary —I did.” 
 
 The king kind oi ruffles up, and says: 
 
 “Looky here, Bilgcwater, what’r you referrin’ to?” 
 
 The duke says, pretty brisk: 
 
 “When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was 
 you referring to?” 
 
 “Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t know— 
 maybe you was asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.” 
 
 The duke bristles right up now, and says: 
 
 “Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense—do you take me for a 
 blame’ fool? Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in 
 that coffin?” 
 
 “ Yes, sir! I know you do know—because you done it yourself!” 
 
 “It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him. The king sings 
 out: 
 
 “Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it all back!” 
 
 The duke says: 
 
 “Well, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money 
 there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come 
 and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.” 
 
 “Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question,, 
 honest and fair; if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and 
 I’ll b’lieve you, and take back everything I said.”
