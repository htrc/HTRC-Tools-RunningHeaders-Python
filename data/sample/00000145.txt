of the late duke seized the title and estates—the infant real duke 
 was ignored. I am the hneal descendant of that infant—I am the 
 rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from 
 my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, 
 ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companion¬ 
 ship of felons on a raft!” 
 
 Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to com¬ 
 fort him, but he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much 
 comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that 
 would do him more good than most anything else; so we said 
 we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow, 
 when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,” 
 or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him 
 plain “Bridgewater,” which he said was a title, anyway, and not 
 a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do 
 any little thing for him he wanted done. 
 
 Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim 
 stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have 
 some o’ dis, or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see 
 it was mighty pleasing to him. 
 
 But the old man got pretty silent, by and by—didn’t have 
 much to say, and didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that 
 petting that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have 
 something on his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he says: 
 
 “Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, 
 but you ain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.” 
 
 “No?” 
 
 “No, you ain’t. You ain’t the only person that’s ben snaked 
 down wrongfullv out’n a high place.” 
 
 “Alas!” 
 
 “No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his birth.” 
 And by jings, he begins to cry. 
 
 “Hold! What do you mean?” 
 
 “Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of 
 sobbing.
