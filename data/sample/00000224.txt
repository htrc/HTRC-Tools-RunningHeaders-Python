The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and lois 
 pard, and bis eye lights up bke be judged he had got the king this 
 time, and says: 
 
 “There—you’ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark 
 on Peter Wilks’s breast?” 
 
 Both of them spoke up and says: 
 
 “We didn’t see no such mark.” 
 
 “Good!” says the old gentleman. “Now, what you did see on 
 his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he 
 dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between 
 them, so: P—B—W”—and he marked them that way on a piece 
 of paper. “Come—ain’t that what you saw?” 
 
 Both of them spoke up again, and says: 
 
 “No, we didn't. We never seen any marks at all.” 
 
 Well, everybody was in a state of mind now; and they sings 
 out: 
 
 “The whole hilin of’m’s frauds! Le’s duck ’em! le’s drown 
 ’em! le’s ride ’em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at 
 once, and there was a rattling pow-wow. But the lawyer he 
 jumps on the table and yells, and says: 
 
 “Gentlemen—gentlemen! Hear me just a word—just a single 
 word—if you please! There’s one way yet—let’s go and dig up 
 the corpse and look.” 
 
 That took them. 
 
 “Hooray!” they all shouted; and was starting right off; but 
 the lawyer and the doctor sung out: 
 
 “Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and 
 fetch them along, too!” 
 
 “We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t find them 
 marks we’ll lynch the whole gang!” 
 
 I was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn’t no getting away, 
 you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, 
 straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the 
 river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough 
 and it was only nine in the evening.
