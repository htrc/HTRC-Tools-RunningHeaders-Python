I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last, I was so 
 fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could 
 afford it. But I didn’t. As I sprang aboard I sung out: 
 
 “Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, 
 we’re shut of them!” 
 
 Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, 
 he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning, 
 my heart shot up in my mouth, and I went overboard back¬ 
 wards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab 
 all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But 
 Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and 
 so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king 
 and the duke, but I says: 
 
 “Not now—have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut 
 loose and let her slide!” 
 
 So, in two seconds, away we went, a-sliding down the river, 
 and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on 
 the big river and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a 
 bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times, I couldn’t help 
 it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed 
 mighty well—and held my breath and listened and waited—and 
 sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here 
 they come!—and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff 
 hum! It was the king and the duke. 
 
 So I wilted right down on to the planks, then, and give up; 
 and it was all I could do to keep from crying. 
 
 CHAPTER XXX 
 
 when they got aboard, the king went for me, and shook me by 
 the collar, and says: 
 
 “Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our 
 company—hey?”
