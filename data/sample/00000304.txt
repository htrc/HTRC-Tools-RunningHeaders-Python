a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t seem to want to ever stop 
 talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then, if I 
 reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and 
 might be laying at this minute, somewheres, suffering or dead, 
 and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip 
 down, silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and

 and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old 
 grey head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep. 
 
 CHAPTER XLII 
 
 the old man was up town again, before breakfast, but couldn’t 
 get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table, thinking, 
 and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee

 man says:
