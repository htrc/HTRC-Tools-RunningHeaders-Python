“Why?” 
 
 “Because Mary Jane’ll be in mourning from this out; and first 
 you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order 
 to box these duds up and put ’em away; and do you reckon a 
 nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?” 
 
 “Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he come 
 a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I 
 was. I stuck tight to the wall, and kept mighty still, though 
 quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if 
 they catched me; and I tried to think what I’d better do if they 
 did catch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think 
 more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I 
 was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the 
 straw tick that was under the feather bed, and crammed it in a 
 foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right, now, 
 because a nigger only makes up the feather bed, and don’t turn 
 over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn’t in 
 no danger of getting stole, now. 
 
 But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was 
 half-way downstairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid 
 it there till I could get a chance to do better. I judged I better 
 hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed 
 it they would give the house a good ransacking. I knowed that 
 very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I 
 couldn’t a gone to sleep, if I’d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat 
 to get through with the business. By and by I heard the king and 
 the duke come up; so I rolled off of my pallet and laid with my 
 chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was 
 going to happen. But nothing did. 
 
 So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones 
 hadn’t begun, yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.
