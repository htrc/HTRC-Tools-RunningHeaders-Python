any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it 
 or bust. 
 
 Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because 
 nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says: 
 
 “What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the 
 river that you all goes to see sometimes?” 
 
 They says: 
 
 “There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.” 
 
 “That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary 
 Jane she told me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful 
 hurry—one of them’s sick.” 
 
 “Which one?” 
 
 “I don’t know; leastways I kinder forget; but I think it’s-” 
 
 “Sakes ahve, I hope it ain’t Hannerl ” 
 
 “I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s the very one.” 
 
 “My goodness—and she so well only last week! Is she took 
 bad?” 
 
 “It ain’t no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss 
 Mary Jane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.” 
 
 “Only think of that, now! What’s the matter with her?” 
 
 I couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so 
 I says: 
 
 “Mumps.” 
 
 “Mumps your granny! They don’t set up with people that’s 
 got the mumps.” 
 
 “They don’t, don’t they? You better bet they do with these 
 mumps. These mumps is different. It’s a new kind, Miss Mary 
 Jane said.” 
 
 “How’s it a new kind?” 
 
 “Because it’s mixed up with other things.” 
 
 “What other things?” 
 
 “Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysipelas, and con¬ 
 sumption, and yaller janders, and brain fever, and I don’t know 
 what all.” 
 
 “My land! And they call it the mumps ?”
