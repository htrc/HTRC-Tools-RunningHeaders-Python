the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the 
 people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate—been a 
 pirate for thirty years, out in the Indian Ocean, and his crew was 
 thinned out considerable, last spring, in a fight, and he was home 
 now, to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he’d 
 been robbed last night, and put ashore off of a steamboat without 
 a cent, and he was glad of it, it was the blessedest thing that ever 
 happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy

 tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would

 done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five 
 or six times—and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody 
 wanted him to live in their houses, and said they’d think it was 
 an honour; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-
