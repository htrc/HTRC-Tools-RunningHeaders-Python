was too scared. And besides, a body couldn't breathe, and hear 
 such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill 
 Turner. He says: 
 
 “He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our 
 shares to him now, it wouldn’t make no difference after the row, 
 and the way we’ve served him. Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn 
 State’s evidence; now you hear me. I’m for putting him out of 
 his troubles.” 
 
 “So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet. 
 
 “Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. Well, then, 
 that’s all right. Let’s go and do it.” 
 
 “Hold on a minute; I ain’t had my say yit. You listen to me. 
 Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s got to be 
 done. But what I say, is this; it ain’t good sense to go court’n 
 around after a halter, if you can git at what you’re up to in some 
 way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into

 “You bet it is. But how you goin’ to manage it this time?” 
 
 “Well, my idea is this; we’ll rustle around and gether up

 for shore and hide the truck. Then we’ll wait. Now I say it ain’t 
 a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and 
 washes off down the river. See? He’ll be drownded, and won’t 
 have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that’s a 
 considerable sight better’n killin’ of him. I’m unfavourable to 
 killin’ a man as long as you can git around it; it ain’t good sense, 
 it ain’t good morals. Ain’t I right?” 
 
 “Yes—I reckon you are. But s’pose she don’t break up and 
 wash off?” 
 
 “Well, we can wait the two hours, anyway, and see, can’t we?” 
 
 “All right, then; come along.” 
 
 So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled 
 forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said in a kind of coarse 
 whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with 
 a sort of moan, and I says:
