if they owned the place, and so forth, and so on, and then I got 
 easy again. She was right about the rats. You’d see one stick his 
 nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she 
 had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, 
 or they wouldn’t give her no peace. She showed me a bar of 
 lead, twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with 
 it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and 
 didn’t know whether she could throw true, now. But she 
 watched for a chance, and directly she banged away at a rat, but 
 she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then 
 she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away 
 before the old man got back, but of course I didn’t let on. I got

 She said that that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive

 “Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your 
 lap, handy.” 
 
 So she dropped the lump into my lap, just at that moment, 
 and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. 
 But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked 
 me straight in the face, but very pleasant, and says: 
 
 “Come, now—what’s your real name?” 
 
 “Wh-what, mum?” 
 
 “What’s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?—or 
 what is it?” 
 
 I reckon I shook hke a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to 
 do. But I says: 
 
 “Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I’m 
 in the way here. I’ll-” 
 
 “No, you won’t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain’t
