time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, 
 all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, 
 nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a 
 gaudy time of it with the audience; but nothing of the sort; pretty 
 soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says: 
 
 “Well, how’d the old tiling pan out this time, Duke?” 
 
 He hadn’t been up town at all. 
 
 We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below 
 that village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and 
 the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they’d 
 served them people. The duke says: 
 
 “Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep 
 mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d

 Well, it is their turn, and I’d give something to know how much 
 they take for it. I would just like to know how they’re putting

 “Well, it don’t, because it’s in the breed. I reckon they’re all

 “But, Huck, dese kings o’ ourn is regular rapscallions; dat’s jist 
 what dey is; dey’s reglar rapscallions.” 
 
 “Well, that’s what I’m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscal¬ 
 lions, as fur as I can make out.” 
 
 “Is dat so?” 
 
 “You read about them once—you’ll see. Look at Henry the
