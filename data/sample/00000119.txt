range of the front windows—there warn’t none on the side. They 
 held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, “Why 
 he ain’t a Shepherdson—no, there ain’t any Shepherdson about 
 him.” Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn’t mind being 
 searched for arms, because he didn’t mean no harm by it—it was 
 only to make sure. So he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only 
 felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me 
 to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but
