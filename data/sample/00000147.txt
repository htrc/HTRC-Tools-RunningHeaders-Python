“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time, on this 
 h’yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour? 
 It’ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain’t my fault I wam’t 
 born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t born a king—so what’s 
 the use to worry? Make the best o’ things the way you find ’em, 
 says I—that’s my motto. This ain’t no bad tiling that we’ve 
 struck here—plenty grub and an easy life—come, give us your

 The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. 
 It took away all the uncomfortableness, and we felt mighty good

 don’t get into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings 
 and dukes, I hadn’t no objections, ’long as it would keep peace in 
 the family; and it warn’t no use to tell Jim, so I didn’t tell him. 
 If I never learnt nothing else out of pap I learnt that the best 
 way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have 
 their own way. 
 
 CHAPTER XX 
 
 they asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know 
 what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the day¬ 
 time instead of running—was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I: 
 “Goodness sakes, would a runaway nigger run south?” 
 
 No, they allowed he wouldn’t. I had to account for things 
 some way, so I says: 
 
 “My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I 
 was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother
