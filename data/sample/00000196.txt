holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to the circus, 
 nor theatre, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.” 
 
 “Nor church?” 
 
 “Nor church.” 
 
 “But you always went to church?” 
 
 Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man’s 
 servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation 
 how a valley was different from a common servant, and had to 
 go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the
