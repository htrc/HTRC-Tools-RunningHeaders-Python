snow on the ground, and I seen somebody’s tracks. They had come 
 up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then 
 went on around the garden fence. It was funny they hadn’t come 
 in, after standing around so. I couldn’t make it out. It was very 
 curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped 
 down to look at the tracks first. I didn’t notice anything at first, 
 but next I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with 
 big nails, to keep off the devil. 
 
 I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over 
 my shoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody. I

 take it—won’t you?” 
 
 He says: 
 
 “Well, I’m puzzled. Is something the matter?” 
 
 “Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing—then I 
 won’t have to tell no lies.” 
 
 He studied a while, and then he says: 
 
 “Oho-o. I think I see. You want to sell all your property to me 
 —not give it. That’s the correct idea.” 
 
 Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and
