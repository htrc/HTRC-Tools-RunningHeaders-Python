the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had 
 his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young 
 Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and 
 Harney’s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and 
 rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn’t wait. 
 We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn’t

 twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode
