“No, sir, nobody.” 
 
 I heard the people stirring around in the house, now, and see 
 a light. The man sung out: 
 
 “Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool—ain’t you got 
 any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you 
 and Tom are ready, take your places.” 
 
 “All ready.” 
 
 “Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?” 
 
 “No, sir—I never heard of them.”
