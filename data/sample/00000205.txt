the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they 
 wanted to. 
 
 So the next day after the funeral, along about noontime, the 
 girls’joy got the first jolt; a couple of nigger traders come along, 
 and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day 
 drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the 
 river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. 
 I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their 
 hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it 
 most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn’t ever 
 dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the 
 town. I can’t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them 
 poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other’s 
 necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all but would 
 a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowcd the sale 
 warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week 
 or two. 
 
 The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many 
 come out flat-footed and said it was scandalous to separate the 
 mother and the children that way. It injured the frauds some; 
 but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could 
 say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy. 
 
 Next day was auction day. About broad-day in the morning, 
 the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, 
 and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says: 
 
 “Was you in my room night before last?” 
 
 “No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him 
 when nobody but our gang warn’t around. 
 
 “Was you in there yisterday er last night?” 
 
 “No, your majesty.” 
 
 “Honour bright, now—no lies.” 
 
 “Honour bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth. I 
 hain’t been anear your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and 
 the duke and showed it to you.” 
 
 The duke says:
