“Yes-indeedy.” 
 
 “And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?” 
 
 “No, sah—nuffn’ else.” 
 
 “Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?” 
 
 “I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben 
 on de islan’?” 
 
 “Since the night I got killed.” 
 
 “No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun? Oh, 
 yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you kill sumfn’ en I’ll make 
 up de fire.” 
 
 So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built 
 a fire hi a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal 
 and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar 
 and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because 
 he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big 
 cat-fish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him. 
 
 When breakfast was ready, we lolled on the grass and eat it 
 smoking hot; Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most 
 about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we 
 laid off and lazied. 
 
 By and by Jim says: 
 
 “But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty, 
 ef it wam’t you?” 
 
 Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He 
 said Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. 
 Then I says: 
 
 “How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?” 
 
 He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. 
 Then he says: 
 
 “Maybe I better not tell.” 
 
 “Why, Jim?” 
 
 “Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I ’uz to 
 tell you, would you, Huck?” 
 
 “Blamed if I would, Jim.” 
 
 “Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”
