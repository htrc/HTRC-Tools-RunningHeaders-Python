went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back, 
 he could have the reward and expenses. 
 
 “Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the day¬ 
 time if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming, we can 
 tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam 
 and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, 
 and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little 
 raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the 
 reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but 
 it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much 
 like jewellery. Ropes are the correct thing—we must preserve 
 the unities, as we say on the boards.” 
 
 We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be 
 no trouble about running day-times. We judged we could make 
 miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the pow-wow 
 we reckoned the duke’s work in the printing office was going to 
 make in that little town—then we could boom right along, if 
 we wanted to. 
 
 We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly 
 ten o’clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, 
 and didn’t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it. 
 
 When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, 
 he says: 
 
 “Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run across any mo’ 
 kings on dis trip?” 
 
 “No,” I says, “I reckon not.” 
 
 “Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den. I doan’ mine one er two 
 kings, but dat’s enough. Dis one’s powerful drunk, en de duke 
 ain’ much better.” 
 
 I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he 
 could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this 
 country so long, and had so much trouble, he’d forgot it.
