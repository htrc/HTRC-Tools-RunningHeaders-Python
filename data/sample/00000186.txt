could hear a pin fall. And when they got there, they bent over 
 and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they burst 
 out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and 
 then they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hung 
 their chins over each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes 
 or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. 
 And mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place
