“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was 
 gwyne to shove for sho’ if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne 
 to swim to de raf ’ agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you 
 did fool ’em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes’ dodge! I tell you, chile, 
 I ’speck it save’ ole Jim—ole Jim ain’t gwyne to forgit you for 
 dat, honey.” 
 
 Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise, 
 twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a 
 steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted 
 to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for 
 the raft to go, but he wished he was already there. 
 
 Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular 
 about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things 
 in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting. 
 
 That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town 
 away down in a left-hand bend. 
 
 I went off in the canoe, to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a 
 man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up 
 and says: 
 
 “Mister, is that town Cairo?” 
 
 “Cairo? no. You must be a blame’ fool.” 
 
 “What town is it, mister?” 
 
 “If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here 
 botherin’ around me for about half a minute longer, you’ll get 
 something you won’t want.” 
 
 I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said 
 never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned. 
 
 We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out 
 again; but it was high ground, so I didn’t go. No high ground 
 about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day, on 
 a tow-head tolerably close to the left-hand bank. I begun to 
 suspicion something. So did Jim. I says: 
 
 “Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.” 
 
 He says: 
 
 “Doan’ less talk about it, Huck. Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.
