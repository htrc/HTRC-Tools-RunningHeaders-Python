“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons, yet” 
 
 She says: 
 
 “Go ’long to your play, and don’t bother me. I know better, 
 I counted’m myself.” 
 
 “Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make but 
 nine.” 
 
 She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count 
 —anybody would. 
 
 “I declare to gracious ther’ ain't but nine!” she says. “Why, 
 what in the world—plague take the tilings, I’ll count’m again.”

 had the odd spoon; and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst 
 she was a giving us our sailing-orders, and Jim got it all right, 
 along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was very well 
 satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice 
 the trouble it took, because he said now she couldn’t ever count 
 them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn’t
