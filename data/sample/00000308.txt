being shot, when I was telling how him and me put in that 
 dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger. 
 
 But I had plenty of time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick¬ 
 room all day and all night; and every time I see Uncle Silas 
 mooning around, I dodged him. 
 
 Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they 
 said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick¬ 
 room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a 
 yam for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and 
 sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he 
 was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In 
 about a half an hour, Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I 
 was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set 
 down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be 
 joyful now, because all the symptoms was first rate, and he’d 
 been sleeping hke that for ever so long, and looking better and 
 peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right 
 mind. 
 
 So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and 
 opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says: 
 
 “Hallo, why I’m at home ! How’s that? Where’s the raft?” 
 
 “It’s all right,” I says. 
 
 “And Jim?” 
 
 “The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash. But he 
 never noticed, but says: 
 
 “Good! Splendid! Now we’re all right and safe! Did you tell 
 aunty?” 
 
 I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: 
 
 “About what, Sid?” 
 
 “Why, about the way the whole thing was done.” 
 
 “What whole thing?” 
 
 “Why, the whole thing. There ain’t but one; how we set the 
 runaway nigger free—me and Tom.” 
 
 “Good land! Set the run-What is the child talking about! 
 
 Dear, dear, out of Iris head again!”
