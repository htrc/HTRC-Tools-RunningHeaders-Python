le’s all three slide out of here, one of these nights, and get an 
 outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over 
 in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or so; and I says, all right, 
 that suits me, but I ain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and 
 I reckon I couldn’t get none from home, because it’s likely pap’s 
 been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher 
 and drunk it up. 
 
 “No he hain’t,” Tom says; “it’s all there, yet-—six thousand 
 dollars and more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since. 
 Hadn’t when I come away, anyhow.” 
 
 Jim, says, kind of solemn: 
 
 “He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.” 
 
 I says: 
 
 “Why, Jim?” 
 
 “Nemmine why, Huck-—but he ain’t cornin’ back no mo’.” 
 
 But I kept at him; so at last he says: 
 
 “Doan’ you ’member de house dat was float’ll down de river, 
 en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered 
 him and didn’t let you come in? Well, den, you k’n git yo’ 
 money when you wants it; kase dat wuz him.” 
 
 Tom’s most well, now, and got his bullet around his neck on 
 a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, 
 and so there aint nothing more to write about, and I am rotten 
 glad of it, because if I’d a knowed what a trouble it was to make 
 a book I wouldn’t a tackled it and ain’t a-going to no more. 
 But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the 
 rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me and civilize me, 
 and I can’t stand it. I been there before. 
 
 The End 
 
 Yours truly 
 Huck Finn
