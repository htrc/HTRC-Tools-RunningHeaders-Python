“What’re you alassin’ about?” says the baldhead. 
 
 “To tliink I should have lived to be leading such a life, and 
 be degraded down into such company.” And he begun to wipe 
 the corner of his eye with a rag. 
 
 “Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for you?” 
 says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish. 
 
 “Yes, it is good enough for me; it’s as good as I deserve; for
