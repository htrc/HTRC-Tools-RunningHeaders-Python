He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it 
 down, and says: 
 
 “Gimme a case-knife.” 
 
 I didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought. I scratched 
 around amongst the old tools, and got a pick-axe and give it 
 to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word. 
 
 He was always just that particular. Full of principle. 
 
 So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shovelled, turn 
 about, and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about half an hour, 
 which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal 
 of a hole to show for it. When I got upstairs, I looked out at the 
 window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, 
 but he couldn’t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says: 
 
 “It ain’t no use, it can’t be done. What you reckon I better do? 
 Can’t you think up no way?” 
 
 “Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular. Come up the stairs, 
 and let on it’s a lightning-rod.” 
 
 So he done it. 
 
 Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in 
 the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow 
 candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins, and laid for a 
 chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom said it wasn’t enough; 
 but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see the plates that Jim throwed 
 out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds 
 under the window-hole—then we could tote them back and he 
 could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says: 
 
 “Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the tilings to Jim.” 
 
 “Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it 
 done.” 
 
 He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody 
 ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. 
 By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but 
 there warn’t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we’d 
 got to post Jim first. 
 
 That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten,
