handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any 
 store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candle-stick, and a 
 gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bed-quilt off the bed, and 
 a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and 
 thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and 
 a fish-line as thick as my little finger, with some monstrous hooks 
 on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horse¬ 
 shoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label on 
 them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry¬ 
 comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow and a wooden 
 leg. The straps was broke off of it, but barring that, it was a good 
 enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough 
 for Jim, and we couldn’t find the other one, though we hunted 
 all around. 
 
 And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we 
 was ready to shove off, we was a quarter of a mile below the 
 island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in 
 the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up, 
 people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off I paddled 
 over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile 
 doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn’t 
 no accidents and didn’t see nobody. We got home all safe. 
 
 CHAPTER X 
 
 after breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess 
 out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to. He said 
 it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and 
 ha’nt us; he said a man that warn’t buried was more likely to go 
 a-ha’nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. 
 That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn’t say no more; but I 
 couldn’t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who 
 shot the man, and what they done it for.
